Can you find what token would allow you to log-in as the user _david_?

[Check this gist](https://gist.github.com/mimoo/8d8c02b9fe299f0ed10bff63092052e8). The file `submarine.py` is the code used to create and parse tokens. I hope it helps!

If you can forge a token to log-in as david, can you send it to me? I really need to get in that submarineâ€¦
